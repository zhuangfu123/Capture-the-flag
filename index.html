      <h1>Welcome to Capture the flag!</h1>
      <p>
        In this game, you compete with others to solve challenges and find
        hidden flags. The game will be played entirely in the terminal, so be
        prepared to use your coding skills. Here's how to get started:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Step 1: Make sure you have these tools on your computer, we've
        downloaded them for you
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Terminal emulator (such as terminal on Mac or command prompt on
          Windows)
        </li>
        <li>Python 3.x</li>
        <li>Git</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you find that your computer does not have these tools, please call
        the teacher.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Step 2: Clone repository Game challenges and tokens are stored in Git
        repositories. First, clone the repository to the local machine using the
        following command:
      </h4>
      <code>git clone [repository URL]</code>
      <p>
        Replace [repository URL] with the URL of the repository provided by the
        game administrator. Once you've cloned the repository, you're ready to
        play.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 3: Solve the challenge.</h4>
      <p>
        This flag will be a file in the Linux file system that you must find,
        and grant read permission to. Once the file has been read, the CTF will
        be considered complete. A cheat sheet and instruction sheet will be
        provided.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Are you ready? Join the game and feel the charm of computer science!
